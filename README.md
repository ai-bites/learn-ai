# Learn AI
List of youtube videos and resources to learn AI for FREE. The main intention of this repo is to keep the content listed here completely free so that anyone with time and motivation can go and learn. 

Let the (Machine) Learning begin!


## Road Map
The roadmap is divided into a generalist and specialist contents. The generalist contents cover the fundamentals that are essential for getting started with Machine Learning. The contents caters for varied background of people learning AI. For example, if you hold a degree in Mathematics, then you can safely ignore the mathematics content and focus on programming to strengthen your programming skills. On the other hand, if you have worked as a software engineer for a few years, you may choose to spend more time with Mathematics content to strengthen the Maths concepts.

## Generalist
Any generalist in AI should be fluent in Mathematics, Programming and Fundamentals of Machine Learning.

### Deep Learning and Neural Networks
To learn Deep Learning, its better to choose between the PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks. If you are confused, you may try out both to begin with and then choose one based on whichever feels good and convenient to you. 
I personally chose PyTorch when it was at its beta version and loved it ever since.

## Specialist
By learning the above you will be more of a generatlist in Machine Learning. However, these days experts are preferred over generalist, mainly due to the depths each area of the field has reached. For example, a company providing text summarization service would prefer someone who has worked in NLP (with experience in LLMs as added advantage) rather than someone who has worked in speech recognition. 

For this reason, it is better to choose a specialization of your choice once you have covered the fundamental courses. In the below section, I have grouped the specialization into general data science, NLP, Computer Vision and covered what you need to learn technically to be find a job in each of the specialist roles. I have also curated learning resources available under each specialisation so that you can jump start your specialization straightaway. 

If you are struggling to choose between NLP and Computer Vision, there is are crash courses on both which can help you decide:

### Data Science Expert
Data scientists mostly work with time series and tabular data. For this reason, its best to learn packages like NumPy, SciPy, ScikitLearn which have impementations of most mathematical operations data scientists use on a day to day basis. They also plot and visualize data quite a lot and so its important to strengthen your Matplotlib.
